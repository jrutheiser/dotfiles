# Dotfiles

Dotfiles is currently just a backup of some of my dotfiles. I'd eventually like
to set this up with a bash installer script to setup full development environments on
Linux and OS X.

## To-do's

- [ ] Add more dotfiles
- [ ] Add Sublime Text preferences
- [ ] Add OS X install bash script
- [ ] Add Linux install bash script
- [ ] Improve README
